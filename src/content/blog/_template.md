## TL;DR

One short paragraph. The single most important takeaway, written so a busy reader can
stop here and still get value. Plain language, no jargon, no questions, no opening with "I".

## Intro

Two to four sentences setting the scene: what observation, situation, or trigger led to
this post. Be specific. Tie to a concrete pattern from the system landscape work.

## Main section 1

The first substantive section. Opens with a concrete claim and supports it with one
example, one mechanism, or one piece of evidence. Two to four short paragraphs.

### Sub-point (optional)

Use sub-headings only when the structure earns it. Most posts are stronger with two or
three top-level sections than with deep nesting.

## Main section 2

The second substantive section. Often: "and the consequence is", "and the mechanism is",
or "and what changes when this is in place".

## Main section 3 (optional)

Only if the post genuinely needs three sections. Otherwise skip — two sections plus
intro and conclusion is plenty for most posts.

## Conclusion

Two to three sentences that close the loop opened in the intro. Restate what changed,
what is now possible, or what the reader should take away.

## Key takeaways

- One sentence. The most important point.
- One sentence. The second most important point.
- One sentence. The third, if relevant. Three to five total, never more than seven.
